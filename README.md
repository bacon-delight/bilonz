## Overwatch | Bilonz IoT Cloud Platform

Repo for APIs: https://bitbucket.org/bacon-delight/bilonz-api/src/master/

This project was built for integrating data from IoT sensors to our cloud. We had over 25 users during the peak, implementing their IoT projects using this platform.

#### Why is this not deployed?
I had to cancel the hosting and sell off the domain due to lack of time to spare on improving this project. The main idea for me at that time was to test that I could create a SaaS (I suppose this could be API as a Service too) that could simplify IoT data transfers and it worked!

#### What's next?
Although this project is abandoned for now, I might later think of trying out something related to IoT again and improve upon this. Time will tell :)
